                          pagebox-dx.txt

This directory contains examples for a new feature of dvipdfmx.def:
support of an option [pagebox=artbox, etc.] in PDF inclusion, like
that in pdflatex, in the case of latex, platex, and uplatex with the
driver program dvipdfmx. The feature is supported in dvipdfmx.def
version 4.06 or later ones. It requires a new dvipdfmx which is not
in TeX Live 2015. The new dvipdfmx will be available in TeX Live 2016.
Interested users may build themselves the new dvipdfmx by using new
sources in the TeX Live repository.

There is a Makefile for GNU Make. All test files are written by Y. Terada.

Note that results are different in the case of dvipdfmx, pagebox-dx.pdf,
compared with those for pdflatex, pagebox-pd.pdf, when the pagebox option
is not given. This is because BoundingBox is determined in the order of
precedence: CropBox --> ArtBox --> TrimBox --> BleedBox --> MediaBox
in the case of dvipdfmx. We keep the order for compatibility with old
documents which use dvipdfmx. In the case of pdflatex and xelatex, the
order is CropBox --> MediaBox --> BleedBox --> TrimBox --> ArtBox.
