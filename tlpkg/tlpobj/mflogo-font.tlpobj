shortdesc Metafont logo font.
longdesc These fonts were created in Metafont by Knuth, for his own
longdesc publications. At some stage, the letters 'P' and 'S' were
longdesc added, so that the MetaPost logo could also be expressed. The
longdesc fonts were originally issued (of course) as Metafont source;
longdesc they have since been autotraced and reissued in Adobe Type 1
longdesc format by Taco Hoekwater.
